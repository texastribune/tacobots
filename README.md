_Exactly what to do._<br>
_When it got a command,_<br>
_It explained what was banned,_<br>
_So confusion would not ensue._<br>

_The mistakes it would spy,_<br>
_It always announced without guile._<br>

## [Source Reminder](./source-reminder/README.md)
> _&ldquo;Who is a Texan?&rdquo; / As soft-serve cascades outward / from its dispenser,_<br>
_retrograded not / the swirls as a horse gallops, / never planting all four hooves_<br>
_in the earth at once._ / _Wherefore, the cross-reference told._ / _How to include all:_<br>
_that easy and hard._ / _Lauded, uncomplicated._ / _Each identity._<br>

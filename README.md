## StyleBot
_There once was a bot who knew,_<br>
_Exactly what to do._<br>
_When it got a command,_<br>
_It explained what was banned,_<br>
_So confusion would not ensue._<br>

## Hoedown Helper: 
_A bot wore a hat with style._<br>
_It never lacked a smile._<br>
_Perhaps this is why,_<br>
_The mistakes it would spy,_<br>
_It always announced without guile._<br>
